Everything seems to be, as it is meant to be,
All of us in the ground, as reason just fades away.
Íll never be wrong again, Íll never be rich or poor,
Couldn't we talk again, well couldn't we just pretend.

(Chorus)
The shadows on the wall are nearly half way there,
Tomorrows seldom just another day,
You say if you leave me all alone,
I wouldn't find words to say.

Reality strikes again, teaches all we know,
Science is never wrong, well Gravity Never Failed.
America seems to care, well somebody has to know,
Couldn't we talk again, well couldn't we just pretend.

(Chorus)
(Chorus)
