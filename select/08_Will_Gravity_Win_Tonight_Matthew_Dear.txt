Scared upon scared alike
Get caught in the simple like
Oh what can be done tonight?
We can't be led 'cause our feet touch the ground

I want it to be done
I want it to be done
I want it to be done
I want it to be done

Will gravity win tonight?
I can't put up a fight
My body is so uptight
I can't object 'cause my feet touch the ground
