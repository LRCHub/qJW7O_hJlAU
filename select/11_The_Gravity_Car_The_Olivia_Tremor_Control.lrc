[00:52.92] I peeked inside of your gravity car
[00:57.59] It won't go far with marbles found in a barnyard
[01:02.53] I saw the distance between us and felt
[01:06.92] For once in my life, I believe what I'm saying
[01:29.92] 
[01:12.57] I peeked inside of your gravity car
[01:17.30] Through open fields past the graveyard
[01:22.80] I guess I'm wrong when I say we won't get far
[01:27.61] Look where we are now
